      <h1>The Sport — Growth, Tradition & Youth Engagement</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        Sports development research shows how traditional activities can attract young participants while preserving their heritage. Sheepdog trials are applying proven strategies: clear entry pathways, visible youth progression, and digital learning communities.
      </p>

      <!-- SECTION 1 -->
      <section>
        <h2>History in Brief</h2>
        <p>
          The first recorded sheepdog trial took place in Bala, Wales, in 1873. Since then, trials have evolved from practical shepherding challenges into structured competitions with international championships. Despite the growth, the heart of the sport remains unchanged — partnership between dog, handler and sheep.

      <!-- SECTION 2 -->
      <section>
        <h2>Youth Engagement — What Works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Accessible entry points:</strong> beginner-friendly training days and small rental fields reduce financial and land ownership barriers.</li>
          <li><strong>Visible youth achievement:</strong> young handler categories and publicised success stories inspire newcomers.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital community:</strong> video tutorials, social media clips and online coaching connect young learners with mentors worldwide.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 3 -->
      <section>
        <h2>The Unbroken Thread</h2>
        <p>
          Across generations, one theme remains constant: partnership. The handler’s responsibility, the dog’s instinct, and their shared trust form the core of trial success. Technology helps with learning, but nothing replaces time on the field, reading sheep and refining timing.
        </p>

              Watching real trial footage helps learners understand pressure management, course decisions, and how top handlers react to unpredictable sheep behaviour. (Replace the placeholder image with rights-cleared or self-shot material for your assignment.)
