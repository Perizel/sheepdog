      <p class="lede">
        The sport celebrates a deep partnership between dog and handler. To keep that tradition alive we highlight
        accessible entry points, visible youth achievement and digital communities that share learning and inspire
        newcomers.
      </p>

      <!-- HISTORY -->

      <section class="profile-block">
        <h2>History &amp; Tradition</h2>
        <p>
          The sport grew from shepherding and practical tests of skill into organised trials and championships. The
          hallmark of every era is partnership: a handler's timing and a dog's initiative working together on the land.
        </p>

        <div class="citation-block">
          The first recorded trials and the continued tradition of partnership shape how the sport is taught today.

      <!-- YOUTH ENGAGEMENT -->

      <section class="profile-block">
        <h2>Youth Engagement — Pathways That Work</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Accessible entry points:</strong> training days and rental fields lower barriers for those who do
            not own land.</li>
          <li><strong>Visible youth achievement:</strong> publicised youth success provides role models and motivation.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Digital community:</strong> online coaching, short clips and mentorship create global learning
            networks.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Programs that celebrate young handlers and make learning visible help the sport attract new people while
          keeping core practice intact.

      <!-- PRACTICAL SKILLS -->

      <section class="profile-block">
        <h2>Practical Skills &amp; Course Awareness</h2>
        <p>
          Learners should study timing, line choices, and the feel of pressure and release. Watching runs (via linked
          videos on creators' channels) helps new handlers understand courses and decision-making.

                <b> Youth at Elite Levels </b>
              </p>

              <p>
                The 2025 International Supreme Young Handler championship crowned 14-year-old Chelsea Elkin,
                demonstrating
                that youth and elite performance aren’t mutually exclusive. Working with her dog Marchup Jan at the
                prestigious Brynkinalt Estate in Chirk, Wrexham, Elkin displayed the skill, composure, and partnership
                that
                defines championship-level trialing. As the announcement noted, such achievement “at such a young age is
                truly inspiring—the future is very bright for Chelsea and Marchup Jan.”
              </p>

              </div>

              <p>
                At just 14, Elkin’s success proves the sport actively welcomes and celebrates young talent. The
                International Sheepdog Society’s dedicated young handler categories provide pathways for emerging
                competitors to test themselves at the highest levels, competing alongside—and often
                outperforming—handlers
                with decades more experience. Young handlers aren’t tokens in this sport—they’re winning internationally
                and
                raising standards.
              </p>

              <h4>Accessible Pathways</h4>
              <p>
                The next generation of handlers often comes from unexpected backgrounds, proving the sport welcomes
                anyone
                with dedication. Victoria Graham, a childminder from Cumbria, exemplifies how sheepdog trialing fits
                diverse
                lifestyles. After watching her friend Tom Rome work his dogs, Graham was captivated: “I thought his
                skill
                was amazing and I knew I wanted to try it for myself.”
              </p>

                  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full journey from childminder to competitive handler</a>
              </div>

              <p>
                Over nine years, Graham progressed from nervous beginner to open trial winner. Her first dog, Pip—bred
                by
                Rome and trained by Jeremy Martin—“put up with all my mistakes” as Graham learned through new handler
                and
                novice trials. By 2019, they won their first open competition. Graham achieved her dream of competing at
                the
                English National: “I will never forget walking out onto that trial field with her, such a special
                experience
                and one that I will always treasure.”
              </p>

              <p>
                Graham then bred and trained her own dog, Teal, renting a small field nearby to start a flock of
                Hebridean
                sheep specifically for training. Teal’s successful first nursery season—placing most weekends, winning a
                nursery championship, and making the reserve list for the English Nursery Final—proved that dedicated
                training outside traditional farming contexts produces competitive results.
              </p>

              <p>
                After losing Pip in 2023, Graham continued with new pup Ivy, maintaining her unique approach: dogs
                accompany
                her childminding work during the day, socializing with children before gathering sheep in the field.
                Reflecting on her journey, Graham emphasizes the emotional core that defines serious handlers: “Each dog
                has
                been a huge part of my life, and I could not imagine my days without them.”
