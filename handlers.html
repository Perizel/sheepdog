      <h1>Generations of the Whistle</h1>
      <p class="byline">By Divine • January 2025</p>

      <p class="lede">
        The whistle’s sharp call has echoed across British hillsides since 1873, when R.J. Lloyd Price organised the first recorded sheepdog trial in Bala, Wales. Today’s trials demand the same skills shepherds perfected, while a new generation documents training, analyses runs, and proves the sport is thriving.

      <!-- SECTION 1 -->
      <section>
        <h2>The Wisdom of Experience — Julie Hill</h2>
        <p>
          Julie Hill’s career demonstrates how passion becomes expertise: International Supreme Champion (1996), Reserve International Supreme Champion (2006), International Brace Champion, and Scottish National Champion. In 2021 she co-founded Sheepdog School — a structured video platform that brings championship-level teaching to learners worldwide.

            <p>
              Hill emphasises partnership over dominance. Her approach encourages initiative in dogs, using pressure-and-release methods rooted in animal behaviour. This develops dogs that think independently and perform confidently even when handlers cannot see the sheep.

        <h2>Accessible Pathways — Victoria Graham</h2>
        <p>
          Victoria Graham moved from childminding to competing nationally. Without owning a farm, she rented training fields and progressed through mentorship, novice trials and persistent practice. Her story proves you don’t need land to succeed — access, guidance and dedication matter most.

      <section>
        <h2>Youth at Elite Levels — Chelsea Elkin (2025)</h2>
        <p>
          The 2025 International Supreme Young Handler Championship crowned 14-year-old Chelsea Elkin — a sign that young handlers can reach the highest levels. Youth categories, mentorship and structured training support this growth.

          Digital communities and visible youth achievements are making the sport more accessible and inspiring than ever.
